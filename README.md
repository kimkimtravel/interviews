# Interviewing @ kimkim

The goal of these sample projects is to mimic a common workflow: reviewing a spec and come up with a (initial) approach.

Write as much code as you need to get your ideas accross, but **you should not fully implement the spec end-to-end for this**. 

You can keep everything in 1 file, just be clear what belongs where.

Feel free to supplement certain areas with pseudocode/comments, but use your judgement on where it's unnecessary to see the level of detail in the design review, and where it's a bit "hand-wavy" to skip important details.

The Code Design Review, In Scope/Out of Scope generally apply to any of the projects. But double check any project-specific requirements that may add extra information.

## Code Design Review
You've read through the spec, looked at the design, and you have a pretty good idea how you are going to approach it.

Before diving in, writing all the code, and submitting a pull request, we are going to have a code design review to go through your planned approach. 

Perhaps the requirements have changed?

### In scope
Prepare your approach and any code/details to help facilitate a thorough discussion of the approach, tradeoffs, etc.

You will need to write *some* code before the review discussion to show your approach and test out a few of your assumptions/ideas to see if they work as you expect they will.

Treat this as if it were a project assigned to you your first week at kimkim. Ask questions, clarifications, bounce ideas if that's helpful.

### Out of scope
Build only what you need in order to be able to communicate your approach to another engineer on the team.

YOU DO NOT need to fully implement this project. This is not intended to be a "takehome project" at that level. It does not need to be complete, be syntactically correct, or "compile/run". But there should be enough structure, scaffolding, placeholders to understand how it works. 

We are more interested in the approach of any logic/helper classes, not the front end views (eg, skip any `.html.erb`, `.css`, `.js` work you may do, assume that's out of scope). 

If you feel like you want to show how your code would handle the end-to-end logic for one of of the placements/views, that's fine (but don't do this for all 5 placements).

Don't worry about multiple files/directory structure/etc. You can put everything in 1 file, just clearly show what belongs where.

## Anything unclear?
